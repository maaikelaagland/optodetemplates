# Optodetemplates
This is the official location of optode template xml files, any work done on optode templates should be done through this repository.

To request access contact jorn@artinis.com (not sure if needed for github organisational repo)

There are three different optodettemplate.xml files in this repository.

1. Official (`official/optodetemplates.xml`)  
2. Custom (`custom/optodetemplates.xml`)  
3. Development (`development/optodetemplates.xml`)  

The **Official** template file should only contain templates that has been reviewed and approved by a member of the "template checking group" ([list of people]).

Custom templates that were requested (or made) by customers or project partners, but are of no general use shouldn't be included in the official release, these should be placed in the **Custom** template file.

Templates used for development purposes should be put in the **Development** template file.

Adding a new template to an optodetemplate.xml file can be done in three different ways. The examples in the instructions below uses the `official/optodetemplates.xml` file, but the procedures generalise to the other files.

Plese refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/kdarti/optodetemplates/wiki) for instructions on how to add templates and what the workflow is for each template file.
